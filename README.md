#  Hooks ðŸ‘‡

## Lists of hooks commands with some practice examples

#### --- Higher order components *(a pattern where a function takes a component as an argument and returns a new component..made use of class component for this practise)*

#### --- Render props *(Refers to a technique for sharing codes between components using prop whose value is a function)*

#### --- Context *(provides a way to pass data i.e values through the components tree without having to pass props down manually at every level)*

#### --- UseState *(A new feature addition in React that allows the use of a state, example working on a counter,  Object and Array)*

#### --- React router *(install react-router-dom@6, used to navigate links in react)* 
#### --- UseEffect *(unlike the componentDidMount, componentDidUpdate, componentWillUnmount in class components, the useEffect lets you perform side effects in functional components and it is a close replacement for the life cycles mentioned earier i.e the cycles in a class components example practised on counter and setting a count interval timeout)* 

#### --- DataFetching *(axios package was installed to host the url,practise was on fetching lists of data, fetching individual data and fetching data with a button click)*
